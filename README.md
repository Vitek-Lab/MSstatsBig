# MSstatsBig

MSstatsBig provides support for very large data files which either do not fit 
into a standard computer's memory, or take a very long time to process. These 
data files are generally the output of spectral processing tools, such as 
Spectronaut or FragPipe. This workflow was designed with DIA experiments in mind.
